Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally.
 These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass.
 Cells may spread metastasize through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.

Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). 
Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.

Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. 
But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do.
 It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.
