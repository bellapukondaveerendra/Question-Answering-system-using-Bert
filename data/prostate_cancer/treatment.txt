Determining whether the cancer has spread using Once a prostate cancer diagnosis has been made, your doctor works to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. If your doctor suspects your cancer may have spread beyond your prostate, one or more of the following imaging tests may be recommended:
tests for prostate cancer are Bone scan, Ultrasound,Computerized tomography (CT) scan,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
Not every person should have every test. Your doctor will help determine which tests are best for your individual situation.
Your doctor uses the information from these tests to assign your cancer a stage. Prostate cancer stages are indicated by Roman numerals ranging from I to IV. The lowest stages indicate the cancer is confined to the prostate. By stage IV, the cancer has grown beyond the prostate and may have spread to other areas of the body.
